# Challenge proposal for my application to the Mindera Graduate Program


``cd MinderaGP``

``npm install``

open an android virtual device from Android Studio and run ``react-native run-android`` or just run ``react-native run-ios`` for an iOS simulator.

To solve the front end challenge I used react native (no CRNA). I've been learning reactJS and react native in the last few months at a slow pace and it seemed like a good opportunity to get more into it.

At first I made the app as simple as possible using only [react navigation](https://reactnavigation.org). At a later stage I decided to add [redux](https://redux.js.org), axios and [native base](https://nativebase.io) to learn how to use them.

#### side note:

Not as part of the challenge, but I made a simple API with php just to read from a mysql database and show some dummy content to populate the app.
